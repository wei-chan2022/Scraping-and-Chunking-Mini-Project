You will receive an email notification once the import is complete.\nIs there a limit to the number of tasks that can be imported at once?\n",
  "There are no hard limits on number of tasks that can be imported, but we recommend limiting imports to 20K tasks per teamspace.\nHow are subtasks imported?\nThey are imported as subtasks (along with dependencies) that are within the same  database.\nDo updates I make in my Asana account automatically get updated in Notion?\nNo, the import is a one-time action.\nWe do not maintain a connection with your Asana account and any changes you make in your Asana account after the importwill notautomatically update in Notion.\nIs there a way to preview the import before they are added?

  "Email hasn't changed much since the early 2000s, but the way we work sure has. These days, everything flows through our inbox\u2014 from closing deals and helping customers to setting up meetings (not to mention lots and lots of junk). But traditional inboxes just weren't built for modern work. They get cluttered fast and eat up time with manual tasks that could be spent on what matters.\nThat's where Notion Mail comes in. We've reimagined email from the ground up to create an inbox that works the way you do\u2014 bringing together Notion's flexibility with powerful AI. Whether you want to hit inbox zero, build better customer relationships, or put those repetitive tasks on autopilot, we've got the tools to make email work for you.\n",

Tell it what matters to you, and it'll automatically sort your emails so the right messages float to the top.\n- Personalize your inbox to your work\u2014 Set up custom views that reflect how you work best, whether you like to sort by urgency, sender, or any other priority.\n- Create reusable responses with snippets\u2014 Save your go-to responses as snippets and let Notion AI help craft thoughtful replies, so you can focus on your most valuable work.\n- Use built-in scheduling\u2014 Set up meetings directly from your inbox, eliminating the ping-pong of finding the perfect time between multiple tools.\n\n",

  "Managing a busy inbox can be challenging. While traditional email tools rely on simple labels and folders, today's work needs a smarter approach. With Notion Mail, you can organize your inbox in a way that helps you focus on what matters most.\nFor example, if you manage a startup, you might want your inbox to show investor emails first\u2014 saving you from digging through less urgent messages. With views, you can quickly spot what needs your attention. Here\u2019s how:\n\nH3: 1. Use filters to hide the noise\n",
  "Filters help you cut through the clutter and focus on what matters. Navigate to the top right of your inbox to access the filter icon. You'll find familiar options like \"read\" and \"unread,\" plus some favorites from Notion databases like the \"select\" property for custom tags. Looking for calendar invites? There's a filter for that too! You can mix and match filters to organize your inbox exactly how you need it.\nCreate custom tags using the select property\nClick to expand\n\nH3: 2. Group emails on how you work best\n",
  "Using theGroup byoption takes organization even further by providing common ways to structure your inbox. You can group emails by domain or sender \u2014 perfect for keeping track of messages from key clients or stakeholders. You can also group by priority, which is ideal if you use your inbox as a task list. You can also customize priority tags however you want.\nAfter playing with groups and filters, save your favorite setups as views to quickly get the inbox snapshot you need.\n\nH3: 3. Play around with flexible grouping to set your perfect view\n",
  "Now that you\u2019re familiar with groups and filters, it's time to save your setup as a customized view. To get started, click the+option underViewsin the left sidebar to create a new view. You can either start from scratch or pick from our pre-built templates.\nHere are three powerful views that'll help you stay on top of what matters most:\n\n- Prioritize based on contacts\u2014Being available and responsive to people who impact your work the most is often the top priority. Let's say you're a founder who needs to stay on top of partner emails. You can quickly set up a view by grouping emails by sender or domain, add your key partner, and just like that, you have a dedicated space to track all their messages.\n\n",

You can then add additional tags to quickly identify which messages need urgent attention and which can wait.\n\n",

  "Your inbox should be smarter and free of little annoyances, like manually labeling emails. Notion Mail is powered by AI to automatically do the heavy lifting for you.

It learns your preferences and tags incoming emails just the way you want them, freeing up time for what really counts.\nHere are three ways you can ask Notion AI to label your incoming emails:\n\n- Label emails from specific domains\u2014Say you frequently receive automated emails from delivery services, subscription notifications, and other services that you'd rather keep organized but out of focus. You can tell Notion AI to spot these domains and label them for you automatically.\n",

There are three builds available:Intel (x64),Apple Silicon (arm64), andUniversal (x64 or arm64). Ensure you distribute the correct build to match your employees' machine types.\n\nNote:The Universal build works on Intel and Apple Silicon machines. Keep in mind the installation file is much larger than the other builds.\n\nH2: Disable automatic updates\n",
  "Notion allows you to disable automatic updates for individual users. This feature is useful for when you want to test new Notion app versions before a widespread rollout, or if you prefer to stagger the update process. To keep the app working smoothly and securely, we advise updating Notion with each new version release.\nTo prevent Notion from automatically checking for updates, run the following terminal command as each user who will be running Notion:\ndefaults write notion.id NotionNoAutoUpdates -bool YES\nUse the following command to re-enable automatic updates:\ndefaults write notion.id NotionNoAutoUpdates -bool NO\n\nH2: Allow users to update Notion\n",

However, if the app is installed in the /Applications folder, update permissions are required.Users must be machine administrators and have write access to /Applications, notion.app, and all its subfiles.\nFor shared machines, we recommend setting up a permissions group for all Notion users and installing Notion in a subfolder of /Applications.

  "Members can be added to workspaces on the Free Plan at no charge. Workspaces with more than one member will be able to use up to 1,000 blocks in that workspace.

To do this, you can avoid adding new members, remove existing members, and add any collaborators asguests.

  "H1: HIPAA configuration\n\nH2: Learn about how to make your Notion workspace HIPAA compliant, and how to enable HIPAA compliance \ud83c\udfe5\n\n- Configuring Notion for HIPAA\n- Enable HIPAA compliance\n- Deactivate HIPAA compliance\n\nThe Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) is a US federal law that was enacted in 1996 that requires the protection and confidential handling of protected health information (PHI) by covered entities such as healthcare providers, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouses, as well as their business associates.\nThis article provides users required product configurations to make their Notion workspace HIPAA compliant.\n\n",
  "Note:Notion's Business Associate Agreement (BAA) governs the protection of Personal Health Information (PHI) that is stored in the Notion Service. To be eligible to sign Notion\u2019s BAA, you must subscribe to our Enterprise Plan.\nNotion Calendar, any Notion Calendar features, and any Beta Services are not covered by the BAA and therefore may not be used or deployed in a manner that processes protected health information.\nTo the extent that any language on this page and language found in the BAA conflict at any time, the BAA shall control.\n\nH2: Configuring Notion for HIPAA\nHIPAA Technical Safeguard Requirements\nNotion's Supporting Configurations\nAccess Control\n",
  "Implement technical policies and procedures for electronic information systems that maintain electronic protected health information to allow access only to those persons or software programs that have been granted access rights.\nNotion\u2019s SAML SSO is built upon the SAML 2.0 standard, connecting your Identity Provider (IdP) and workspace(s) for an easier, more secure login experience. Notion supports official configurations for SAML SSO with: Azure, Google, Gusto, Okta, OneLogin, and Rippling.\nTo get started using SAML SSO with Notion, you'll need to complete the following steps:\n",
  "Verify domain(s):To use advanced security features, you must verify ownership of your email domain. This is an automated process that involves adding a TXT record onto your domain\u2019s DNS to verify your ownership of it.\nEnable SAML SSO:This will toggle the feature on and complete the configuration. For more information on completing the SAML SSO configuration, please refer tothis article.\nChange default login method:Once SAML SSO is enabled for the first time, the default login method will be set toAny method, meaning that users have the option of logging in via SAML or their normal login method. By setting this toOnly SAML SSO, this enforces SAML as the login method for your workspace for managed users with verified company emails.\n",
  "Link additional workspaces:If you have more than one workspace you\u2019d like to configure with SSO, you can do so by reaching out to[email\u00a0protected].\nOnce properly configured, any members signing into your workspace(s) will need to use the verified domain and will need to be authenticated through your identity provider. Enterprise workspace owners are able to bypass by using an alternative login method in case there\u2019s an IdP/SAML SSO failure.\nUnique User Identification\nAssign a unique name and/or number for identifying and tracking user identity.\n",
  "Notion has a SCIM API which can be used to provision, manage, and de-provision members and groups. Workspace owners can find the required API key by going toSettings\u2192Security & identity\u2192SCIM Configurationand clicking to view the token.Please seeour SCIM documentationfor the latest information on how you can interact with Notion\u2019s SCIM API. Notion supports official SCIM applications with Google, Gusto, Okta, OneLogin, and Rippling.\nEmergency Access Procedure\nEstablish (and implement as needed) procedures for obtaining necessary electronic protected health information during an emergency.\n",
  "Content search provides Enterprise workspace owners with visibility into workspace content to improve governance of the workspace and resolve page access issues. Content search allows you to:\u2022 View who has access to a page\u2022 Modify the permissions of a page\u2022 Discover and re-assign abandoned pages from former employeesYou can export a Notion page, database, or entire workspace at any time.\nFor Notion Mail, enableHIPAA compliance with Google Workspace.\nAutomatic Logoff\nImplement electronic procedures that terminate an electronic session after a predetermined time of inactivity.\n",
  "Set custom session duration:For managed users on the Enterprise Plan, Notion has a default session duration of 180 days. However, workspace owners can customize their session duration from 1 hour to 180 days.Force logout managed users:Force logout for individual users or for all workspace users at once.Force password reset:Force password reset for individual users or for all workspace users at once.If you de-provision a user via SCIM, they will be removed from the workspace and their session will be terminated.\nAudit Controls\nImplement hardware, software, and/or procedural mechanisms that record and examine activity in information systems that contain or use electronic protected health information.\n",
  "Enterprise workspace owners have access to an Audit Log viaSettings. This gives an overview of a large range of events that have occurred in the workspace.\nThis can be especially helpful for identifying potential security issues, investigating suspicious behavior, and troubleshooting access. The workspace audit log can be exported in CSV format.\nEnterprise customers can also utilize ourData Loss Prevention (DLP) partner integrationsto discover, classify, and protect sensitive data in Notion.\nFor Notion Mail, enableHIPAA compliance with Google Workspace.\nIntegrity Controls\n",

  "Disable public page sharing:This will disable the Share to web option in the Share menu on every page in this workspace.Disable guests:This prevents anyone from inviting people outside the workspace to any page. You don\u2019t need to use this control if you\u2019d like to invite guests as needed, but note that Notion may not be used to communicate with patients, plan members, or their families and employers. If you need to enable guests, we recommend turning onguest requests. This implements an approval process so that you can have guests in your workspace while ensuring HIPAA compliance.Disable moving or duplicating pages to other workspaces:This prevents anyone from moving or duplicating pages to other workspaces via the Move To or Duplicate action.Disable export:This prevents anyone from exporting as Markdown, CSV, or PDF.Disable workspace creation:This prevents anyone from creating new workspace(s) without approval.Disable or allowlist third party extensions:This prevents anyone from adding non-approved 3rd party extensions to your Notion workspace.Disable external workspace access:This prevents managed users from joining or accessing external workspace outside of your organization.\n",
  "For Notion Mail, enableHIPAA compliance with Google Workspace.\nPerson or Entity Authentication\nImplement procedures to verify that a person or entity seeking access to electronic protected health information is the one claimed.\n",
  "Disable profile changes:This prevents managed users from changing their own profile information to avoid impersonations.Domain management:Domain refers to the email address domain associated with a Notion account. Domain verification allows workspace owners to claim ownership over a domain, which will unlock domain management settings.Disable guests:This prevents anyone from inviting people outside the workspace to any page.

  "Anyone with at leastViewaccess to a database can see all the existing Slack notifications that have been set up. However, they can\u2019t edit or create any themselves.\nHow do permissions work when I share a Notion page in a Slack channel?\nThe user that shares the pagewill get a prompt informing them some people in the channeldon't have access to the doc. The user is then able to decide if they want to share the page with the people that don't have access. They also have the option to delete the page preview in Slack.\nCan admins control who can connect Slack to a Notion workspace?\n",
  "As an admin in Slack you can manage settings that give you approval rights for any Slack integration. The same settings will apply to Notion if you choose to turn them on.\nOn Enterprise plans, Notion admins can also restrict members from installing the Slack integration using their admin permissions to manage connections.\nWhere can you view and manage the Slack notifications you've set up in your Notion workspace?\nDatabase notifications can be managed and edited in the the individual database they\u2019ve been created in. There is currently no way to see all database notification workflows in your workspace from one central place.\nPersonal @-mention notifications can be managed fromSettings\u2192Notifications.\n",
  "When one person connects Notion to Slack, does that turn it on for everyone?\nNo, when one user sets up the integration all Slack users will be able to see an unfurled Notion page link or a Slack link preview in Notion.\nBut to use the functionality themselves, other users have to connect Slack individually.\nHow do I send Slack messages to a specific database view?\nThe easiest way to send a Slack message to a specific database view (e.g. you might have a view for only your team\u2019s tasks), is to copy the link to the database view and paste that link into the send to Notion prompt in Slack.\nWhen you send a Slack message to a specific database view, the properties are auto-filled for you. No need to update them yourself manually!\n",
  "Does the @-mentioned notification in Slack work when a user is mentioned as part of a group @-mention in Notion?\nYes. A group mention in Notion will trigger the @mention notification in Slack to all members of the Notion group that have the Slack @mention turned on.\nAre there other 3rd party integrations providers and can I continue to use them (e.g. Zapier)?\nYes.

  "\nH1: What is a database?\n\nH2: Databases are a core feature in Notion that help you manage and organize your pages. Let's explain what they are and how they can help you level up your workspace \ud83d\uddc4\n\n- Databases are collections of pages\n- Databases are pages themselves\n- Databases have properties\n- Database views display the same content in different ways\n\n\nH2: Databases are collections of pages\nThink of Notion databases as filing cabinets or notebooks. Each database serves as a container, letting you easily organize multiple Notion pages in a single structure. In the screenshot below, every row of the table is a page within the database \"Docs.\"\n",
  "This gives you a birds' eye view of an entire collection of pages at once. When you need to dive deeper, each page in a database can be opened, revealing its detailed contents.\n\nH2: Databases are pages themselves\nBut wait - each database is also a page itself! This is powerful, because it allows you to move and nest databases alongside other content, just like any other page.\n\nH2: Databases have properties\nTo help you organize all of the pages within a database, properties can be added to contextualize, label, and augment each individual item.\nYou can then search, filter, and sort by these property values.\n\nH2: Database views display the same content in different ways\n",
  "Databases in Notion are not static. The set of pages within each database can be displayed in many different forms, or what we call views.\nIn addition to table view, the contents of a database can be visualized as a list, board, calendar, gallery, or timeline - whatever makes the information the most useful.\n\n\nH3: Was this resource helpful?\n\nH3: Create a database\nNow we'll create a database and use it to show off essential database actions and features.

So let's assume you've made theCustomersandItemsdatabases above for the purpose of this walkthrough.\n\n- Add a new column/property to yourCustomersdatabase and give it a name, likeItems Purchased.\n- Search forRelation.\n- Then, search for the database you want to create the relation with.\n- You'll see a preview of the relation.

You'll be prompted to choose a new database.\n\n\nH2: Two-way relations\nRelations are created as one-way by default. But you can easily toggle on a corresponding relation in the destination database.\nWith two-way relations, the edits work both ways! So if you add a customer to theItemsdatabase in the relation column, the change pops up in yourCustomersdatabase.\n\n- Follow the above instructions to create a new relation property.\n- Click the toggle that saysShow on [name of related database]. In our example, this saysShow on Items DB.\n- Give this corresponding relation a name.\n- Below, you'll see a preview of the two-way relation.

For example, let\u2019s say you have a database of frequently asked questions at your company. Each FAQ has a relation to a page that further explains the answer to the question. You might want people to also be able to see the owner of each page, so they know who to reach out to with more questions. You can set your FAQ database up so that the owner is visible along with the relevant page!\nTo do this:\n\n- Open a page in a database that has a relation property.\n- Click the field next to that property to link a page \u2192 click\u2022\u2022\u2022.\n- In the menu that appears, drag the properties of the related database into or out ofShown in relationorHidden in relation.\n- Once you\u2019re done, you\u2019ll see your desired properties appear in the relation field.

You'll see a second property show up.\n\nTo make it a two-way relation, toggle onSeparate properties. You'll see a second property show up.\n\nH2: Rollups\nRollups help you aggregate data in your databases based on relations. Going back to our customers and items example above, let's say you wanted to know how much each customer spent based on what they bought.\n\n- First, create the relation so you know who bought what.\n- Add a new column/property and chooseRollupfrom theProperty typemenu. Give it a descriptive name.\n",

So, if one item a customer bought didn't have a price and that was the property selected, the rollup column would say 1.\n- Count not empty: Counts the number of related pages with assigned values for the property you selected.\n- Percent empty: Shows the percentage of related pages with no value in the property you selected.\n- Percent not empty: Shows the percentage of related pages with a value in the property you selected.\n",

For now, you can't re-import that CSV back into Notion to re-establish the relations with other databases.\nCan I duplicate a database with a relation?\n",
  "Yes. In the example above, if you duplicate the Customers database, the duplicate database, Customers (1), will not show as a relation in the Items database. That\u2019s because upon duplicating the Customers database, we convert the relation from a 2-way sync to a 1-way sync. If you'd like, you can always convert the relation back to a 2-way sync.\nCan I rollup a rollup?\nUnfortunately not, as this could create unintended loops.

  "H2: Wrong return type\nUnlike formula properties in databases, formulas in automations expect a specific return type from the formulas (ex.: date, text, number, person). The automation will otherwise fail to save and execute properly.\nHow to fix it\nMake sure the formula returns the correct type of value. For example, if writing a formula to set the value of a Person property of a page, the formula must return a user or list of users, not a date. Alternatively, if evaluating a specific condition on an array type property (ex.: multi-select), make sure to use.includesinstead of==in yourif()statement.\n\nH2: Formula depth limit reached\n",
  "Notion formulas can only be15 layers deep. Every time a formula references another formula or rollup, it adds a layer. This applies even if the formula is in a different database.\nWhen this limit is reached, Notion will show an error message.\nHow to fix it\nSimplify your setup by combining unnecessary formulas and rollups into fewer properties.

  "When working with relations, rollup, and person properties in formulas, the formulas return a list of pages or people. To reference properties within the relation, you\u2019ll need to define the first element, otherwise your automation will pause. You might also encounter this issue when creating a formula that uses the map function for a relation property.\nHow to fix it\nUse functions like.first()or.at(0)to get the first element, or loop through the list of pages with functions like.map(),.filter(),.every(),.some(),.find().\n\nH2: Undefined value\nWhen formulas run on an empty value (ex.: Date, Person, etc), the automation will get an error and automatically pause.\nHow to fix it\n",
  "Useifandempty()to check whether a value is present before running the Person or Date function on it.\nFor example, if your formula runs on a Person property named \u201cOwner\u201d, create the following if statement to force a value:if(empty(This page.Person.first()), \u201cNo person\u201d, This page.Person.first().name()). This ensures that even if there is no Owner, the automation will safely execute.\nAlternatively, set up a view that filters to the Date or Person value being defined, and apply their automation to that view.\n\nH2: Common syntax errors\nIf your formula isn\u2019t working as expected, it might be due to a syntax error such as missing parentheses, incorrect operators, or unsupported functions.

  "Notion AI appears seamlessly in your workspace but leverages technology from several AI Subprocessors to provide you with the service. Check out ourSubprocessor Pagefor a complete list of our current Subprocessors, and learn more about Notion AIhere \u2192\n\nH2: How does Notion AI work?\n\nH3: Who are Notion\u2019s Large Language Model Providers?\nNotion currently utilizes various large language models (LLMs) hosted by Notion as well as by organizations such as Anthropic and OpenAI. We continuously evaluate LLM providers and their models to provide the highest quality experience to our Notion AI users. Any third parties that process Customer Data will be published in ourSubprocessor Page.\nHow do I subscribe to new Subprocessor notifications?\n",
  "Customers may sign up to receive notification of new Subprocessors by emailing[email\u00a0protected]with the subject \u201cSubscribe to New Subprocessors.\u201d Once a customer has signed up to receive new Subprocessor notifications, Notion will provide that customer with notice of any new Subprocessors before authorizing the new Subprocessor to process Customer Data. For additional information, please see ourData Processing Addendum.\n\nH3: How does Notion AI use content from a workspace?\nNotion AI is able to reference content from your workspace through two key phases:\n\n- Generating an embedding (i.e., a semantic representation of the information stored in your workspace).\n- Generating responses informed by the content in your workspace.\n\n",
  "Generating an embedding (i.e., a semantic representation of the information stored in your workspace).\nGenerating responses informed by the content in your workspace.\nWhat are embeddings?\nEmbeddings are numerical representations of text or documents. These representations capture the meaning and context of the text in a multidimensional space, where similar topics have similar numerical representations. By using embeddings, vector search algorithms can efficiently compare and find similarities between different pieces of text or documents. For Notion AI, embeddings are created from workspace content to enable the system to provide accurate and relevant responses to user questions.\nHere is an example of an embedding fromOpenAI:\n",
  "[-0.02541878,-0.0104167685,-0.0015037002,...,-0.004155378,-0.00043069973,-0.01679479]\nHow are embeddings created?\n\n- For each page in your workspace, we generate an embedding by using an OpenAI zero-retention embeddings API.\n- Notion receives an embedding for each Notion page and stores it in a vector database (e.g., Turbopuffer). The vector database is a data store optimized for embeddings that enables fast lookup of the most relevant pages given a user request.\n\nFor each page in your workspace, we generate an embedding by using an OpenAI zero-retention embeddings API.\n",
  "Notion receives an embedding for each Notion page and stores it in a vector database (e.g., Turbopuffer). The vector database is a data store optimized for embeddings that enables fast lookup of the most relevant pages given a user request.\nHow are embeddings protected?\nDespite embeddings only being a numerical representation of Customer Data, Notion still treats embeddings with the same level of security and privacy considerations as Customer Data. All our Customer Data commitments outlined in our Master Service Agreement (MSA) and Data Processing Agreement (DPA) apply to embeddings. View ourTerms and Privacy Pagefor more information.\n",
  "We store embeddings with vector databases like Turbopuffer. These vector databases have been vetted by our security team as well as an external auditor to obtain their SOC 2 Type 2 certification.\n\nH3: How are responses generated?\n\n- Notion receives a request from a user.\n- The request is passed to LLMs and AI Models. If the request does not require searching the Notion workspace, a response is generated at this point and returned. If the user\u2019s request requires searching their workspace, LLMs and AI Models generate a search query most relevant for the user request.\n- The query is passed to a vector database, where a list of pages is found based on relevance to that query.\n- Notion sends the query \u2014 and the pages identified by the vector database \u2014 to LLMs and AI Models where the pages are refined and ranked by relevance to the query.\n- The query, refined list of pages, and ranking of pages are processed by the LLMs and AI Models to generate a response that fulfills the user\u2019s request.\n- Notion processes the output to adhere to the right format and language and displays the output to the user.\n",

The LLMs and AI Models used to generate AI responses for a user cannot see or use any information to which that user does not already have access.\n\nH3: How is Customer Data protected when sent to AI Subprocessors?\nNotion AI is designed to protect your Customer Data and prevent information leaks to other users of the service.\n",
  "Prior to engaging any third-party Subprocessor or vendor, Notion evaluates their privacy, security, and confidentiality practices, and executes an agreement implementing its applicable security, privacy, and legal obligations. All Subprocessors are monitored and reviewed at least annually to ensure continued compliance with Notion\u2019s security and privacy expectations. This includes reviewing documents such as attestation reports, penetration tests, and other artifacts based on the Subprocessor\u2019s criticality and other risk factors. As part of the onboarding and ongoing reviews, technology security questionnaires are distributed to vendors and are required to be completed. Significant public security events are also assessed to protect the supply chain attack surface.\n",
  "When we send your Customer Data to third parties, it is encrypted in-transit using TLS 1.2 or greater.\nFor more information about how Notion processes your data, please refer to ourData Processing Addendum.\n\nH3: Will my data be used to train any models?\nBy default, Notion and its AI Subprocessors do not use Customer Data to train any models. We specifically have contractual agreements in place with our AI Subprocessors that prohibit the use of Customer Data to train their models.\nYour use of Notion AI does not grant Notion any right or license to your Customer Data to train our machine learning models.\n\nH3: How is Customer Data segregated?\n",
  "Individual customer accounts are kept separate in our production environment. We do not mix or process data from different customers together during AI processing. This means we do not expose your data to other Notion customers.\n\nH3: What are the data retention obligations of third-party AI providers?\nNotion AISubprocessorshave data retention policies that allow Notion to meetour obligations to customers for the processing of data.\n",
  "When using Notion AI, our LLM providers utilize zero data retention for Enterprise plan workspaces, so no data is stored with LLM providers. For all non-Enterprise plan workspaces, LLM providers only retain Customer Data for 30 days or fewer before deletion. Notion AI is additionally powered by OpenAI's embeddings. OpenAI does not retain any Customer Data through their embeddings service.\nEmbeddings stored in vector databases are deleted within 60 days from when the page or workspace is deleted.\n",
  "If a user deletes a Notion page or Notion workspace, we can restore the content within 30 days. After 30 days, the data is deleted and unrecoverable. This includes any AI-generated data and embeddings. For more information about deleting or restoring your data, please refer tothis article.\n\nH3: What compliance standards does Notion AI meet?\nNotion AI is included in the scope of Notion\u2019s SOC 2 Type 2 report and ISO 27001 certification, demonstrating our commitment to various regulatory and industry standards.\nNotion AI enables HIPAA compliance by utilizing LLM provider\u2019s zero-retention APIs and allows for the processing of protected health information (PHI).\n\nH2: What controls can be added?\n\n",
  "H3: Can data loss prevention (DLP) be configured to alert for data being used by Notion AI?\nCustomers can trigger data loss prevention (DLP) alerts for sensitive content in their Notion workspace using third-party integration partners on our Enterprise Plan. That will include content in an AI prompt and the content generated by AI. Learn more about our DLP integrationshere.\n\nH2: What are the legal considerations?\n\nH3: Are there rules against what I can do with Notion AI?\n",
  "TheNotion AI Supplementary Termsapply to your usage of Notion AI. In addition, Notion\u2019sContent & Use Policyapplies to any content on Notion, including content generated by Notion AI. Violating these terms can result in removal of your content or suspension of access to your workspace.\n\nH3: Who owns the rights to content generated by Notion AI?\nNotion does not claim ownership of your input or the generated output. This is addressed in theNotion AI Supplementary Termsin the \"Input and Output\" section:\n\nNOTE: You may provide input to be processed by Notion AI (\u201cInput\u201d), and receive output generated and returned by Notion AI based on the Input (\u201cOutput\u201d).

Databases\n\n",
  "H3: Databases are collections of Notion pages that help you organize information in a variety of ways. With multiple database views to choose from, you control how to display and search your content.\n\nH1: Articles\n\nH3: Intro to databases\nDatabases in Notion are collections of pages. Here, we'll introduce you to the general structure of a database, walk you through the different menus and options, and deep dive into how to open and edit pages within a database. \ud83d\uddc3\n\nH3: Views, filters & sorts\nYou can view the same database in multiple ways, and switch back and forth between them depending on your needs. Within a view, you can add filters and sorts to easily categorize your content \ud83d\udcc1\n\nH3: Database properties\n",
  "Database properties add all kinds of context to your database items, like due dates, task owners, relevant URLs, last edited timestamps, and more. Use these properties to filter, sort, and search your data \ud83e\udde9\n\nH3: Relations & rollups\nHave you ever wanted to connect the data between two tables? You're in luck! Notion's relation property is designed to help you express useful relationships between items in different databases \ud83d\udee0\n\nH3: Customize your database\nTailor your database to your needs with lots of customization options to choose from \u2728\n\nH3: Database templates\n",
  "Most databases contain the same types of pages created over and over again. Think of weekly meeting notes, bug reports, or design specs. To make this easy, database templates let you define and replicate certain page structures with one click \ud83d\udda8\n\nH3: Sub-items & dependencies\nUse sub-items and dependencies to give depth to any workflow \ud83d\udc23\n\nH3: Task databases & sprints\nHelp your team stay on track with task databases and sprints \ud83d\udcaa\n\nH3: Data sources & linked databases\nNeed to reference database content somewhere else in your workspace? Linked databases let you show, filter, and sort the same source data across multiple locations \u26d3\n\nH3: Optimize database load times & performance\n",
  "Here\u2019s how to make sure your databases are always feeling quick and snappy \ud83c\udfc3\ud83c\udffc\n\nH3: Table view\nA table is the classic database view, but tables in Notion are more than just rows and columns. Each row opens up into its own page, and can contain whatever properties you want \ud83d\udcca\n\nH3: Board view\nBoards are helpful for showing items in a database moving through stages of a process, or grouped by property. Use them for project management and visualizing your data \ud83d\udccb\n\nH3: Timeline view\nFor anyone who needs to visualize their projects plotted chronologically - whether it's hours, years, or anything in between - Notion's timeline is a type of database that keeps you on task and on track \u23f3\n\nH3: Calendar view\n",
  "Calendars let you visualize how database items connect to certain dates. Use one when you want a bird's-eye view for important launch dates, multi-day events, or even projects spanning multiple months \ud83d\uddd3\ufe0f\n\nH3: List view\nLists are simple and minimalist database views. They're ideal for storing notes, articles, and documents that don't need too many properties. Every item in a list is a page that can be opened with one click and store as much content as you need \ud83d\udcdc\n\nH3: Gallery view\nGallery view is the best way to display databases with visual components, like mood boards, office directories, virtual recipe boxes, and more \ud83d\uddbc\ufe0f\n\nH3: Chart view\n",
  "Charts help visualize the vast amount of information in your database. Customize your charts so you can see your data in the way that\u2019s most helpful. You can even put charts from multiple databases into a Notion page to create a powerful dashboard \ud83d\udcca\n\nH3: Unique ID\nAdd an extra layer of project management by giving your tasks their own IDs \ud83e\udd16\n\nH3: Layouts\nCreate an organized layout for your tasks, goals, journal, or anything else you might track in a Notion database \ud83d\udd28\n\nH3: Forms\nLearn how to create, share, and gather information using forms \ud83d\udd8b\ufe0f\n\nH3: Questions?\nEmail us\n[email\u00a0protected]\nJoin our community\nFind any answer\nHire a Certified Consultant\nFind an expert for your needs\n\n\n- \n- \n- \n- \n- \n\n\n\n\n- Company\n- About us\n- Careers\n- Security\n- Status\n- Terms & privacy\n",

In the Notion AI entry point, clickFind into toggle betweenEverything you can access,Notion, andSlack.\n",
  "If I connect Slack to Notion AI, does Notion AI automatically begin searching all of my Slack channels?\nNo. Notion AI only searches public Slack channels, and during initial setup, our configuration options allow you to choose either a discrete set of public channels or all public channels in your workspace to be included. Additionally, you have the option to continuously include all public channels that are created after initial setup. This configuration requires approvals via the Notion workspace owner and the Slack admin.\nWho can access Slack content using Notion AI?\n",
  "Individuals who are both a Slack and a Notion workspace member can use this integration. Notion AI maps Slack members to Notion members, so individuals must be authenticated at the user level for its use. Through account mapping and real-time event subscriptions, Notion conducts ongoing checks for changes to permissions and access levels that would impact the Slack content surfaced in Notion AI for each individual.This integration is not available for guests in your Notion workspace, or guests in your Slack workspace (like people external to your organization that you may communicate with using Slack Connect).\nHere are a few examples of permissions-related scenarios that Notion proactively checks and updates for:\n\n- When users edit or delete a message in Slack, Notion AI monitors for modified or deleted content via webhooks and will reflect these updates in near real-time.\n- Slack or Notion guest users are not allowed to leverage Notion AI at all. In the case where a guest user is given full Slack workspace member and full Notion workspace member permissions, Notion AI monitor for membership changes and updates those permissions changes in near-real time.\n- When a user is deactivated in Slack, Notion AI monitors permissions and updates that permission change within approximately 30 minutes.\n",

Will these channels be indexed?\nNo. All external messages and channels will be excluded.\n",
  "How does Notion store or reference my Slack data in its systems?\nSlack content is stored as embeddings using vector databases like Turbopuffer. These embeddings allow for efficient searches and comparisons across different pieces of text to provide accurate and relevant responses to your questions.\nNotion\u2019s vector databases have been vetted by our Security team as well as by an external auditor to obtain their SOC2 Type II certification.

The feature will also continue to ingest any new messages added to your Slack environment (in either your selected channels or all public channels) after initial configuration to be used for responses to search queries.\nI connected the wrong Notion workspace. How can I disconnect my Slack workspace from Notion?\nTo disconnect your Slack workspace, open Notion AI at the bottom of your screen and click on\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2192Connect Slack\u2192Settings\u2192Disconnect.\n",
  "What happens to my Slack data if I connect to Notion AI and then decide to disconnect?\nNotion treats your Slack content with the privacy principle of data minimization in mind. If you decide to disconnect your Slack environment from Notion AI, your Slack content will immediately become unsearchable, and your Slack data used for Notion AI will be deleted in less than one day from when the request is made.\n\nLearn more\n\n- Notion AI connectors beta\n- Notion AI connectors for Google Drive\n- Notion AI connectors for GitHub\n- What is Notion AI?\n\nNotion AI connectors beta\nNotion AI connectors for Google Drive\nNotion AI connectors for GitHub\nWhat is Notion AI?\n\n\n\nH3: Was this resource helpful?\n\nH3: Notion AI connector for Google Drive\n",

  "Otherwise, you'll need to ask an admin from the workspace to send you an invite.\nHow can groups be used instead of multiple separate workspaces?\nWe've seen people create multiple workspaces instead of groups to set granular permissions. For instance, they create separate workspaces for Design, Marketing, and their executive team so these groups can't access, edit, or get distracted by each other's work. There's a quick workaround for this using groups:\n\n- DisableWorkspace access. That way pages won't show for people and groups who aren't specifically granted access.\n- On every page,\u00a0grant different levels of access per group. Those access levels will hold true for all the sub-pages on that page.\n- So, for example, you could have a section of your workspace just for the engineering team. Create a group of all your engineers, then on the top-level page for that team, turn onFull accessfor only that group. Nest pages inside that page, and only the engineering team can access them, too!\n",

Paid Templates may not be offered through the Notion Marketplace as a mechanism to drive direct or off Notion Marketplace sales (through use of a discount code or otherwise). Should Notion suspect you are engaging in such activity it may suspend or terminate your use of the Notion Marketplace.Payment.Subject to your compliance with these Notion Marketplace Terms of Use, for each sale of your Paid Template, we will remit to you the amount we've received for your sale of your Paid Template, less our Notion Fees, and any applicable taxes (\"Net Proceeds\"), in accordance with Notion\u2019s then standard payment schedule for Paid Templates. You agree to provide the Payment Processor with valid bank account information in your name, so we can remit amounts owed to you to that account via the method we choose. We are entitled to accrue and withhold payments, without interest, until the total amount due to you (net of any tax withholding, as further described below) is at least the minimum required payout amount.\u00a0 You are solely responsible for any bank fees, interest charges, finance charges, overdraft charges, and any other fees you incur as a result of payments made to you.Refund Mechanics. As noted above, we may issue refunds for your Paid Templates to End Users at any time at our sole discretion without liability. If a refund is issued before you receive the Net Proceeds for the refunded sale, you acknowledge that you will have no right to receive such Net Proceeds. If a refund is issued after you\u2019ve received the Net Proceeds for the refunded sale, we may offset such Net Proceeds from any amounts owed to you or we may require you to pay us back such Net Proceeds. If Notion can\u2019t successfully receive payment for any refunded fees owed by you, Notion may cancel your Notion Marketplace account and remove your templates from the Notion Marketplace. Notwithstanding this section, you agree that Notion shall not be responsible for and will not issue any refunds out of its funds (excluding the Notion Fees for the transaction) related to your Paid Template for any reason, including your failure to support the Paid Template. When these Notion Marketplace Terms of Use terminate, we may withhold all payments owed to you for at least 60 days from the date such payments are otherwise due to you in order to ensure we can offset any amounts refunded to End Users or any other amounts we are entitled to.Taxes. Each party is responsible for the payment of all taxes (including any interest and penalties) in connection with these Notion Marketplace Terms of Use that are imposed on that party by law. Each party will be responsible for its own income taxes, employment taxes, and real property taxes. You are liable for all applicable taxes imposed on sales of your Paid Templates to End Users, but we will collect sales tax for such transactions and remit such taxes. We reserve the right to deduct or withhold any applicable taxes payable by you from amounts we owe to you, and the amounts due, as reduced by such deductions or withholdings, will constitute full payment to you. If we were required to collect a tax and did not do so at the time of sale, we reserve the right to later charge you for the applicable tax.\n",

  "You can confirm if your workspace has multiple workspace owners by going toSettings\u2192People. Having more than one workspace owner will subject the workspace to block usage restrictions.\nCan I archive my teamspaces to avoid block usage restrictions?\nNo. Teamspaces are not considered blocks, so they don\u2019t count towards block usage.\nWhat if I need more time to figure out if I want to or can upgrade to a paid plan?\nDon\u2019t worry! We automatically offer a three-day grace period when your workspace hits 1,000 blocks to help you figure out the right next step.\nWhat are my options if I don't want to upgrade to a paid plan?\n",

  "Notion uses a billing model that charges you based on the number of seats, or licenses, you are using in your workspace. One seat is assigned to each member (not guest) in your workspace. This billing model gives you the flexibility to change which specific people join your Notion workspace as a member, without accruing new charges every time you add a new user.\nHere\u2019s an example:\n\n- Your team is working with three contractors, who have been added as members to your Notion instance. When their contracts are finished, you remove them from your Notion workspace.\n- Until the end of your billing period (monthly or annual), you will still have three paid seats in Notion that you can instead fill with new contractors, new hires, interns, or anyone else who you might want to add to your workspace as a member.\n",

  "You always pay for Notion at the start of your billing interval.

  "Plans only apply to a single workspace and don't cover your whole account. We recommend using the fewest workspaces possible, and taking advantage of top-level pages in your sidebar to stay organized.More on that here.\nHow can I avoid needing multiple workspaces?\nWe've seen people create multiple workspace instead of groups to set granular permissions. For instance, they create separate workspaces for Design, Marketing, their executive team, etc. so they can't access, edit, or get distracted by each other's work. You don't need to do this. Instead:\n\n- DisableWorkspace Access. That way pages won't show for people and groups who aren't specifically granted access.\n- On every page,grant different levels of access per group. Those access levels will hold true for all the sub-pages on that page.\n- So, for example, you could have a section of your workspace just for the engineering team. Create a group of all your engineers, then on the top-level page for that team, turn onFull Accessfor only that group. Nest pages inside that page, and only the engineering team can access them, too!\n",

  "In an ideal world, your team's knowledge would be neatly organized in one place, regularly updated, and consistently shared across teams. However, for most organizations, this \"work about work\" often falls to the bottom of the priority list.\nTeams are whisked away by a need to respond here, attend a meeting there, and by the end of the day, they\u2019re drained, and vital knowledge remains scattered and disorganized across tools. While AI chatbots offer promises to speed up our work, they both lack crucial company context and exist in a separate digital space, limiting their usefulness.\nNotion is the first tool to combine your company\u2019s knowledge \u2014 across multiple tools \u2014 right alongside the rest of your work.\n\n",
  "H2: Search across tools with AI connectors\nWhen you integrate JIRA, Slack or Google Drive with Notion AI, you can ask questions and receive relevant information from these connected sources. Notion AI will provide answers and cite the specific references it used, allowing you to access knowledge across multiple platforms seamlessly.\nNotion AI can keep up with Slack discussions, remember every Google Slides presentation, and be accessed with the press of a button \u2014 inside Notion, or globally with the shortcutShift + Cmd + J.\nHere\u2019s how this might show up in your day-to day work:\n\n- Get up-to-date project updates, without a meeting \u2014Try asking Notion AI to \u201cCatch me up on Project Albatross and identify blockers.\u201d It will check your project tracker in Notion, and double-check with your decisions mentioned in Slack \u2014 citing its sources so you can jump in wherever needed.\n- Facilitate better new hire onboarding \u2014New hires have a lot of questions, it\u2019s literally their job to learn! With Notion AI, they can self-serve answers from all of your tools, and therefore trust it\u2019s gathering the full picture. For more inspiration, see how Notion customerdbt Labsused AI to improve teamwork and efficiency.\n- Access your knowledge from anywhere \u2014The last thing you want to do when you\u2019re on the go is search through multiple apps to find the answer to a simple question \u2014 or bug your colleagues when you know you could find it yourself.

  "When you ask Notion AI a question it can\u2019t answer, it will let you know, and provide some thought starters using world knowledge.\nLearn more about privacy with Notion AI connectors\nClick to expand\n\nH2: Transforming your organization with AI connectors\nAI connectors are powerful tools that bridge the gap between Notion and your other workplace applications. These connectors allow Notion's AI to access and utilize information from various sources, creating a more comprehensive and efficient workflow. Here's a deeper look at how AI connectors enhance team\u2019s day to day:\n\n- Reduce time spent searching\u2014On average, workers spend 3 hours a day* searching for information (*Check out theNotion AI ROI templateto learn more) . This wasted time can hinder productivity and innovation. AI connectors transform Notion into a centralized information hub,saving up to 10 minutes per question asked, enabling teams to make faster, more informed decisions.\n- Tap in to otherwise unused knowledge\u2014Too often, valuable ideas are buried deep in Slack threads, intended to be shared later but ultimately forgotten to time. Notion AI has the capability to recall that knowledge right when you need it, maximizing the creative impact of your team\u2019s innovation. It can also cite useful information you didn't even know you had (like a new update from your company's all-hands presentation that pairs well with the report you're working on).\n- Maintain focus and productivity\u2014 Context switching between apps can disrupt your workflow and burden you with distracting messages and notifications. With AI seamlessly integrated into Notion, you can access the information you need without breaking your concentration, allowing you to stay in a productive flow state as long as you need.\n- Consolidate your tool stack\u2014Just like other work software, most AI tools are made up of a set of fundamental actions (we\u2019ve been saying this for years). Notion AI is designed with these building blocks in mind. That means it doesn\u2019tjustallow you to search other tools; but it\u2019s also your team\u2019s chatbot, writing partner, and so much more \u2014 so you don\u2019t have to juggle dozens of apps to get work done.\n",

  "JIRA is a powerful tool for project tracking that many technical teams rely on. Byintegrating JIRA with Notion, you create a seamless workspace where your project management tools work together. This gives everyone\u2014especially those who aren't JIRA experts\u2014a clear, accessible overview of what's happening. The AI Connector for JIRA lets you access your JIRA information right within Notion, so you can find what you need without switching between tools.\nHere's just a few ways you can use the JIRA connector in your workflows:\n\n- Generate project reports and status updates \u2014Pull together quick project snapshots for meetings by asking \"What's the status of the website redesign project?\". Notion AI will gather information on deadlines, blockers, and progress from multiple tickets, helping teams stay aligned without the manual work.\n- Get insights into who is working on what \u2014Ask Notion AI to show what your teammates are tackling in JIRA. Questions like \"Show me what Alex is working on\" or \"Who's fixing the payment bug?\" help you gather info for meetings without missing a beat. Everyone gets clear visibility into workloads\u2014 no JIRA access needed.\n- Troubleshoot technical issues \u2014When something's not working right, ask \"Why isn't the checkout feature working?\" to surface relevant tickets with details about known bugs or challenges.\n",

  "We sometimes say Slack is like the other half of Notion. If all of your permanent docs live inside Notion, then all of your ephemeral conversations happen in Slack. By connecting Slack to Notion, you can bridge the gap between these two crucial communication channels. This integration allows you to seamlessly search and reference Slack conversations directly within Notion, ensuring that no important information slips through the cracks.\nHere\u2019s just a few ways we see the Slack connector show up in teams\u2019 workflows:\n\n- Write smarter status reports\u2014Project managers responsible for writing a daily or weekly status report will appreciate the ability to ask Notion AI to note everything that\u2019s happened in a certain time period.\n- Summarize rambling threads\u2014Extracting insights from threads in Slack can be tedious, but with Notion AI connected to Slack, you can simply ask to gather all ideas related to a certain project and insert them into the document.\n- Keep track of critical announcements\u2014Try using Notion AI to gather context before diving into a brand new doc.

  "H3: Getting started with AI Connector for Google Docs, Sheets and Slides\nGoogle Drive is a vital hub for many teams, housing essential documents, spreadsheets, and presentations. By connecting it to Notion, you're bringing this wealth of information directly into your workflow.\nWith the Google Drive connector, Notion AI can quickly reference key data from Google Documents, Slides or Sheets without switching apps or even compile research from various Google Docs into your Notion projects.\nHere\u2019s just a few ways we see the Google Drive connector show up in teams\u2019 workflows:\n\n- Bring formal messaging into your docs\u2014Your teams may work in Notion, but you likely have a slide library elsewhere with your formal pitches, all-hands presentations, and more. This form of information sharing can be really helpful to individuals trying to succinctly capture and share context ahead of a project.\n- Access legacy knowledge\u2014If you\u2019ve largely switched off of google docs but haven\u2019t imported everything over to Notion, an AI connector can help bridge the gap. This way, you have access to the information you need, but only when you need it.\n- Improve sharing across teams\u2014Some teams' work requires them to stay in other tools. For instance, your legal team might work primarily in Google Docs for contract drafting. The Google Drive connector allows other teams to easily reference key terms in Notion without disrupting the legal team's workflow, ensuring everyone has access to the latest information.\n",

This saves you from manually copying and pasting GitHub PR links into Notion to create relations.\n- Similarly, if your PR description uses magic words associated with \u2018closing\u2019 or \u2018finishing\u2019 a task, the Notion task will be marked as \u2018done\u2019 when the PR is merged.\n",

  "When someone comments on a pull request, that comment shows up automatically in your linked Notion page. This keeps stakeholders like your Product Manager in the loop about technical decisions without them having to leave their project planning view. Plus, other engineers can easily reference these discussions later when working on similar features.\n\nH2: Create custom views and link related data with synced databases\nSynced databaseslet you bring data from other platforms directly into Notion.

  "H3: Create custom views of GitHub pull requests and issues to manage workloads\nNow that you've synced your GitHub issues and pull requests to your Notion database, you can set up custom views that match your workflow. For example, a project manager on your engineering team could create views filtered by engineer assignments or by issue status (open vs. closed).\nTo create a new view, click the+sign at the top right corner of your database. Here are some useful ways to customize your views\u2014\n\n- Add views based on assignee\u2014You can filter by the \"Assignee\" property to see all pull requests or issues assigned to specific team members. This makes it easy to track individual workloads and responsibilities.\n- Add views based on issue status\u2014You can also filter by \"Status\" to see all open pull requests or issues that need review or closed pull requests ready to deploy. This helps identify bottlenecks and track overall progress in your development pipeline.\n",

  "\n\nH1: Create & manage workspaces\nUh-oh! It looks like your ad blocker is preventing the video from playing.\n\nH2: When you're brand new to Notion, it's best to keep it simple and start with just one workspace. But as you start using Notion for more things, and with more groups of people, you can keep different kinds of content separate by using multiple workspaces \ud83c\udfd8\n\n- Create a new workspace\n- Join an existing workspace\n- Switch between workspaces\n- Leave a workspace\n- Delete a workspace\n- Add another email account\n- Log out of an account\n\n\nH2: Create a new workspace\nBy default, your workspace switcher will display all the workspaces associated with your email address.

  "H2: Join an existing workspace\nThere are a couple ways to join a workspace someone else has made:\n\n- An admin from that workspace adds you as a member, and you receive an email with a link to join.

Specific to third party content, Notion AI is handling both private and public content with security in mind, only ingesting content according to the permissions mapping between Google Drive and Notion users.\nHow do shared drives work?\nTo connect a shared drive to Notion AI:\n\n- The drive must live inside your Google Workspace.\n- Shared drives must be included during initial setup.\n- At least one owner of the shared driver must be selected among the users and groups.\n- At least one user selected in the user groups must be a contributor, content manager, or manager for the shared drive.\n",
  "\nThe drive must live inside your Google Workspace.\nShared drives must be included during initial setup.\nAt least one owner of the shared driver must be selected among the users and groups.\nAt least one user selected in the user groups must be a contributor, content manager, or manager for the shared drive.\nWe will respect the permission settings of the drive (if the shared drive was directly shared with you) or the file (if the file has been shared directly with you or with a group that you are a part of).\nHow does Notion store or reference my Google Drive data in its systems?\n",
  "Similar to our core Notion AI product, we store create and store embeddings in a vector database hosted by Turbopuffer, which powers the ability to provide responses to questions that leverage third party content (like in Google Drive). Turbopuffer has been vetted by our security team as well as an external auditor to obtain their SOC2 Type II certification.Learn more about Turbopuffer\u2019s security here \u2192\nWhich account should I use to initiate the connection for Google Drive in Notion?\n",
  "Whichever account is used to initiate connection will be stored in the Notion system as a customer admin email, and we will use this admin email for future updates, so it's important for customers to provide an email that won't change in terms of permissions or active status so that service isn't impacted when, for example, an admin leaves the company. You can use any service email that has admin privileges to your Google Workspace and will remain the same, like[email\u00a0protected].\n\nLearn more\n\n- Notion AI connectors beta\n- Notion AI connectors for Slack\n- Notion AI connectors for GitHub\n- What is Notion AI?\n\nNotion AI connectors beta\nNotion AI connectors for Slack\nNotion AI connectors for GitHub\nWhat is Notion AI?\n\n\n\n",
